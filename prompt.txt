Make Flask (Python-Web) Program with following specs
this program goal to help lecturer  to score the students homework or lab report with help of LLM
the study program is Informatics and the major is vary
institution : Lab FKI Universitas Muhammadiyah Surakarta
This is an internal academic tool, not a public SaaS.

the inputs for the LLM are 
1. 1 pdf file as 'kunci jawaban' (example of 100% score result | optional)
2. Multiple PDF file from students to be scored 
  up to 50 students (default max 50 PDF ; configurable from .env)
3. system prompt (hidden from users ; defined by system)
4. additional parameters 
  - score range (default 40-100 ; configurable from dashboard)
  
the output is a csv file with naming username_timestamp.csv
contain these entries:
1. No (numbering)
2. NIM (student number)
3. student_name
4. Score
5. Evaluation (short evaluation or reason why that score given; max 100 words | can be disabled/enable on dashboard)

System requirements :
1. Language : Bahasa Indonesia
2. simple login page (must login to use this app feature)
   default admin login : username=admin | password=informatika
   1 Users : username=aslab | password=informatika1
   no login timeout
3. flask-admin page
   change password & user management can be done in admin page
   accessible from url baseurl/admin
4. Dashboard
   user able to bulk upload the students Lab Report PDF and upload the 'kunci jawaban'
   user define the score range
   user click on button and the scoring process starts
   fancy loading bar with some note (e.g 'Mengunggah file' , 'Membaca dokumen', 'Menilai laporan' , 'Menyusun hasil' , 'Selesai')
   user download the result .csv file.
   logout button
   
   report to user if failure happened all tell them why.
   
tech stack : flask & Docling
https://github.com/docling-project/docling

additional requirements
- use docling for pdf parser so the data is LLM ready (use context7 - read its docs)
- use easyOCR via docling (default=enabled | configurable via .env)
- Database use sqlite3 ; ORM use sqlAlchemy
- all uploaded documents will be deleted at every start of application or at time 02.00 AM WIB every night (can be disabled on .env)
  so i can keep the running app lightweight
- write the .env.example ;  complete README & gitignore ;  'pipfreeze > requirements.txt' to generate requirements list
- only accept pdf format uploaded file (add file type validation)
- keep the web design simple and intuitive.
- save app logs
  Login attempts, Upload actions, LLM errors, GPU/CPU mode,Cleanup events, etc.
- CORS and CSRF websites or allowed sites are configurable from .env (default all [*])
- enable multithreading for sequential scoring process (number of worker configurable from .env)

# LLM
use gemini-2.5-flah from google ai studio
in .env there are 15 gemini api key (look in .env.example)
roundrobin the gemini api key on sequential scroing process
add failsafe to assign unused API key when reached rate-limit


I heard docling default will use GPU as possible, i want it to use gpu if possible  
make this app deploy-able on docker
use context7 to read documentation (e.g. docling, flask, easyocr)
Read prompt.md for additional and complete system requirements
use figures\readme.png diagram image on readme
use figures\Favicon.png or figures\web for web icons
